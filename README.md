## Description
The project proposes a solution for companies operating fleets of moving vehicles fleets with different routes. Consider the example of a construction company with various worksites in different places or a transportation company with multiple vehicles on overlapping routes. Not all vehicles return to headquarters daily, making fleet monitoring challenging. This problems could be mitigated by using data or cell signal to exchange the information. However, this approach requires constant internet access and subscriptions for network access, as well as servers to process and store the data. Our **concept** is based on ad-hoc communication between the company vehicles, where data is shared between vehicles. When a vehicle reaches the headquarters it reports all his and others gathered data. This enables administrators to access critical information about the entire fleet, such as route made, time that the vehicle spent stationary, consumed fuel, available fuel..., even for vehicles not returning daily. Communication between vehicles and headquarters could also be based in the same communication technology.
